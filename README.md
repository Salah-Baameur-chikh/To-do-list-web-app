**DoZo - To-Do List App

This is a to-do list web app named DoZo. I designed this app keeping in mind to be user-friendly, minimal, and visually appealing. 

**Features:

* Light and Dark Mode:  Users can switch between light and dark mode for a better viewing experience.
* Prioritization: Tasks can be prioritized (high, medium, low) to help users focus on important tasks first.
* Completed Tasks: A separate section to view completed tasks.
* Clean and Minimal Design: The design is clean and avoids clutter, making it easy for users to find what they need.

**Getting Started:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `main.html` file in a web browser.

**Technologies Used:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

**Design:

The UI/UX design for Donezo was created in Figma. You can view the Figma design file here: [https://www.figma.com/design/wj72LDrfDZTLAJAvWD21Z5/To-do-list?node-id=0-1&t=uBmG6O43q4vAEB5I-1](https://www.figma.com/design/wj72LDrfDZTLAJAvWD21Z5/To-do-list?node-id=0-1&t=uBmG6O43q4vAEB5I-1)

I am a UI/UX designer and I am always looking for feedback and suggestions on my projects. Feel free to leave an issue on this repository if you have any feedback or questions.
